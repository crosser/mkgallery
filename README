mkgallery.pl traverses directory tree starting from current directory
downwards, and in each directory creates index.html file with the list
of subdirectories and the list of image files in the directory.
Fielsystem objects starting with '.' are not processed.  For every directory,
a file ".title" is checked, and created if absent, with the title for this
album.  Two subdirectories are created with scaled down versions of the
images: ".640" and ".160", and a direcotory named ".html" containging
slideshow pages (and info pages for non-javascript clients).

For the thing to work, you must create a subdirectory named ".include"
at the root of your image gallery, or somewhere upstairs in the
document tree, and put there files from the subdirectory "include" of
this distribution.  Then, chdir to the root of your gallery and run
"mkgallery.pl" script.  First time, you will be asked to enter titles
for all subdirectories ("Albums"); if you wish to recreate the titles,
remove ".title" files.  If you *don't* want "index.html" to be generated
in some directory, create a file ".noindex".  This way you can preserve
index created by hand or by some other script.

"mkindex.pl" is a simple script that is completely unrelated to the
gallery (theoretically).  If your tree starts with YYYY/DD (four
digit year and two-digit month, this script will create a compact
table with references to individual months, and then a separate list
for subdirectories that are not four-digit.

Requirements:
Image::Info
Image::Magick (might get rid of that later)
Term::ReadLine (not at this moment but planned)

Download:
svn co svn://svn.average.org/mkgallery/trunk mkgallery

TODO:
- try to get get info from APP12 marker for non-EXIF files
- really create info files
- make slideshow "stylish", i.e. use CSS
- make Image::Magick optional
- make title editor based on Term::ReadLine
- anything else that I forgot
